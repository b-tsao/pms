# External port of this server

# Interserver key
argonms.center.auth.key=pass

# Port for remote administration via telnet
# Set it to -1 to disable telnet access
argonms.center.telnet=-1

# true = Use NIO (new IO) for non-blocking socket operations
# false = use old blocking IO for asynchronous socket operations
# Don't touch this if you don't know what you're doing.
# For the center server, it's probably best to always use OIO because we never
# have more than 17 connected remote servers.
# Note that this affects both the interserver listener and the telnet listener.

# Time zone. Leave this blank to use the server's time zone. Time zone
# identifiers of the IANA time zone database may be used, as well as custom
# time offsets from GMT in the form GMT(+/-)(Hours):(Minutes).
