/**
 * Describes every second-level constant value (i.e., a header directly
 * underneath a ClientSendOps constant) used in CommonPackets that isn't already
 * enumerated in a different class. To prevent collisions, each constant is
 * given a meaningful prefix to describe its name space. The class isn't very
 * populated at the moment, but I will do my best in appending on to the list.
 *
 * Maybe one day, I'll group each packet with the same top-level (ClientSendOps)
 * header in a single class and just list the sub headers in that class. Not
 * just one class per file, but maybe a couple of related top-level operations
 * grouped in public static classes in a file.
 *
 * Created as part of an effort to curb magic numbers and to give more meaning
 * to certain constants that are in written in packets sent to clients
