/**
 * <code>LockableMap</code> methods implemented from <code>Map</code> directly
 * call those methods in the provided <code>Map</code> (<code>HashMap</code> by
 * default). None of these inherited methods are altered to become thread- safe.
 * For this reason, the methods inherited from <code>Map</code> must only be
 * performed when the map is read or write locked, depending on the method's
 * behavior. This class is mainly provided to organize and prevent the pollution
 * of a name-space when it is required to provide a lock exclusively for a
 * single <code>Map</code> (i.e. a variable named map of a type that extends
 * <code>Map</code> and a variable named mapLock and of a type that extends
 * <code>ReadWriteLock</code> can be replaced with a single
 * <code>LockableMap</code>). In the scenario as previously described, the
 * method {@link #lockRead()} is equivalent to
 * <code>mapLock.readLock().lock()</code>, the method {@link #lockWrite()} is
 * equivalent to <code>mapLock.writeLock().lock()</code>, the method
 * {@link #unlockRead()} is equivalent to
 * <code>mapLock.readLock().unlock()</code>, and the method
 * {@link #unlockWrite()} is equivalent to
 * <code>mapLock.writeLock().unlock()</code>
 *
 * Convenience methods {@link #putWhenSafe(K, V)}, {@link #getWhenSafe(K)},
 * {@link #removeWhenSafe(K)}, and {@link #getSizeWhenSafe()} are provided in
 * the case that you only need to lock this map for one statement. If you find
 * that you exclusively use these methods and do not ever explicitly (un)lock
 * the <code>Map</code> through {@link #lockRead()}, {@link #lockWrite()},
 * {@link #unlockRead()}, or {@link #unlockWrite()} then you would probably be
 * better off using <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>.
 *
 * <code>LockableMap</code> uses composition instead of inheritance when calling
 * <code>Map</code> operations so that any type of map, not only
 * <code>HashMap</code>, can be used, unlike <code>LockableHashMap</code>.
