/**
 * <code>LockableHashMap</code> does not override any <code>HashMap</code>
 * methods with thread-safe implementations. For this reason, the methods
 * inherited from <code>HashMap</code> must only be performed when the map is
 * read or write locked, depending on the method's behavior. This class is
 * mainly provided to organize and prevent the pollution of a name-space when it
 * is required to provide a lock exclusively for a single <code>HashMap</code>
 * (i.e. a variable named map of type <code>HashMap</code> and a variable named
 * mapLock and of type <code>ReentrantReadWriteLock</code> can be replaced with
 * a single <code>LockableHashMap</code>). In the scenario as previously
 * described, the method {@link #lockRead()} is equivalent to
 * <code>mapLock.readLock().lock()</code>, the method {@link #lockWrite()} is
 * equivalent to <code>mapLock.writeLock().lock()</code>, the method
 * {@link #unlockRead()} is equivalent to
 * <code>mapLock.readLock().unlock()</code>, and the method
 * {@link #unlockWrite()} is equivalent to
 * <code>mapLock.writeLock().unlock()</code>
 *
 * Convenience methods {@link #putWhenSafe(K, V)}, {@link #getWhenSafe(K)},
 * {@link #removeWhenSafe(K)}, and {@link #getSizeWhenSafe()} are provided in
 * the case that you only need to lock this map for one statement. If you find
 * that you exclusively use these methods and do not ever explicitly (un)lock
 * the <code>HashMap</code> through {@link #lockRead()}, {@link #lockWrite()},
 * {@link #unlockRead()}, or {@link #unlockWrite()} then you would probably be
 * better off using <code>ConcurrentHashMap</code>.
 *
 * While <code>LockableMap</code> uses composition, and calls the methods of the
 * underlying <code>Map</code> instance when the methods implemented from
 * <code>hMap</code> are called, <code>LockableHashMap</code> uses inheritance,
 * and so all <code>HashMap</code> operations are sent directly to the
 * <code>HashMap</code> instance (no methods are overridden or implemented).
